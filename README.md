A library for the jailbroken iOS app "AutoTouch"

AutoTouch is a macro tool for jailbroken Apple devices that can record/playback touches and button presses. As the app uses Lua to write the recorded scripts, users can go in and write their own code. AutoTouch supplies many different functions to get/find pixel colors, take screenshots, open/close apps, and more. The formal help document can be found [here](https://autotouch.net/server/doc/en.html). Kent Krantz is creator and owner of AutoTouch. 

This Lua script adds 30+ new functions ranging from additional color converters, the ability to pretty print tables, make edits to specified files, and many other useful functions!

Using Github Pages, I had created a help document (which I modeled the design for based on the original AutoTouch help document) for all the new functions that my library added. If curious, you can view it [here](http://shirtandtieler.github.io/Functions-Plus-Help/).
